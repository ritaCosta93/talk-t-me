Talk t’me is an adapted communication app for iOS.
# Who is this app for
Even though everybody can use this app, I’ve created it thinking about specific groups of people, such as:
* Non-Verbal people
* People with speech delay
* Autistic kids, adults and parents
# How does it work
The Talk t’me  [language system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmentative_and_alternative_communication#/media/File:Sample_page_from_AAC_communication_book.png)  is based on  [AAC devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmentative_and_alternative_communication#/media/File:Minimo.jpg) .
To use this device you don’t need to know exactly how to form senteces, you can skip articles or prepositions and still you will be able to talk, because this is all graphic and the symbols talk by themselves.
# Why is this suitable for non-verbal people?
Non-verbal people often have problems formulating ideas and expressing themselves without the help of gestures or images, that’s where this app comes in.
# The impact on people lives
Communication is a huge part of our life, we are social beings, so, not being able to communicate, cuts off most of the things we take for granted, like asking for help to solve one’s basic needs.
That’s what this app tries to solve.

# Development stages and challenges
